@haroonisrar6390,"Most enjoyable program, Wasim Waqar and now great mind Jadija. What a panel with the best host Fakhar e Alam. A treat to watch."
@aiReacher,"#AskTheRoom

I'm loving the show, sir. My question is to everyone. In the last show, you were discussing the ODI format and how to make it more interesting between 10-40 overs.
I have one silly suggestion: I'm ready to get scolded by Wasim bhai for this 😆.
My suggestion is that, just like in kabaddi there’s a 'Do or Die' raid, where if the last two raids were empty, the next raid must score points, otherwise, the player is out.
Similarly, between 10-40 overs, we could make hitting a boundary mandatory after every two overs. If a boundary isn’t hit, 4 runs should be deducted from the batting team’s total.

Pros

-- More intent in batting
--More exciting
--More opportunities for bowlers to take wickets as batters will take risks, making the game more balanced
--Refreshing format

Cons

--The fielding team might take longer to adjust their field placements due to this rule.

-- Could be too many calculations

What do you think?
From 🇮🇳 

Please take my question 🙏 @team"
